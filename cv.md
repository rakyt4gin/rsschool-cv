3. I have a lot of purposes in diffirent types of activities. But my main purpose is become a front-end developer. I like to learn something new and it's very hard for me, but i don't give up and try again if something doesn't work. I'm a student of BSUIR and don't work, because at first i should get a lot of knowledge from this **perfect course**.
4. HTML5, CSS3, БЭМ, Bootstrap, SCCS, JavaScript, Git, Parcel.js.
